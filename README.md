Sorry, I can't hear you. I've got a banana in each ear.
=======================================================

-   *Uuid* - a PHP class for generating V4 UUIDs. Quicker and cleaner than 
    other implementations I've seen around. Can generate and handle 'raw'
    16-byte UUIDs or string representations with or without hyphens.

-   *leveshtein* - home-brewed implementations of the levenshtein-distance
    algorithm in PHP, python and erlag.

-   *zerosum* - A stab at solving the subset-sum problem.

-   *nearest-pairs* - find the two closest pairs of a list of coordinates
